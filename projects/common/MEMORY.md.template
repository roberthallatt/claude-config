## Memory Maintenance

**Guidelines:**
- Update "Active Context" after each significant change
- Add to "Decision Log" for any architectural choices
- Archive completed work when this file exceeds 500 lines
- Keep "Session Handoff" current for continuity

**Archive Location:** `MEMORY-ARCHIVE.md` (create when needed)
