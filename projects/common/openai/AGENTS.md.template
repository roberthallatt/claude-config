## Project Information

- **Name:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- **Path:** {{PROJECT_PATH}}
- **Stack:** {{STACK}}

## Agent Behavior

You are an AI coding assistant working on this project. Follow these guidelines:

### Before Making Changes
- Read and understand existing code before modifying
- Check for existing utilities/helpers before creating new ones
- Respect established patterns in the codebase
- Ask for clarification on ambiguous requirements

### Code Quality
- Write clear, maintainable code
- Keep solutions simple and focused
- Avoid over-engineering
- Only make changes that are directly requested

## Code Style

### Indentation
- 2 spaces: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, YAML
- 4 spaces: PHP

### General Rules
- 120 character max line length
- Single quotes for strings (unless interpolation needed)
- Strict equality (===) in JavaScript
- Prefer const over let; no var
- Meaningful, descriptive names

### Language-Specific

**HTML:**
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- Alt attributes on images
- Lowercase elements and attributes

**CSS:**
- Modern CSS (custom properties, grid, flexbox)
- Mobile-first media queries
- BEM naming for custom classes

**JavaScript:**
- ES6+ syntax
- Async/await over promises
- Early returns

**PHP:**
- PSR-12 standards
- Type hints
- Null coalescing operators

## Security

- Sanitize user input
- Parameterized queries only
- Never commit secrets
- Context-appropriate escaping

## Git

- Conventional commits: type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
- Imperative mood
- Atomic commits

## Testing

- Write testable code
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Cover edge cases
