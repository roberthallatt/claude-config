# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**{{PROJECT_NAME}}** is a custom project. This configuration was generated using AI-powered discovery mode.

- **Project Path**: {{PROJECT_PATH}}
- **Project Slug**: {{PROJECT_SLUG}}

## Detected Technologies

> Run the `/project-discover` command to have Claude analyze this codebase and populate this section with:
> - Detected frameworks and libraries
> - Project structure analysis
> - Coding standards and patterns
> - Build and development commands
> - Testing setup

## Directory Structure

```
{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
├── [Your project structure will be documented here]
└── ...
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Add your development commands here
# Examples:
# npm install        # Install dependencies
# npm run dev        # Start development server
# npm run build      # Build for production
# npm test           # Run tests
```

## Coding Standards

See `.claude/rules/` for project-specific coding standards.

## Security Requirements

- Never commit credentials, API keys, or secrets
- Sanitize all user input before output
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

## Before Making Changes

1. Understand existing patterns in the codebase
2. Check for existing utilities before creating new ones
3. Follow established conventions
4. Test your changes

## First-Time Setup

After running the setup script with `--discover`, use the `/project-discover` command to have Claude:

1. Analyze your codebase structure
2. Detect frameworks and libraries in use
3. Research best practices for your stack
4. Generate custom rules, agents, and workflows
5. Update this file with project-specific information
