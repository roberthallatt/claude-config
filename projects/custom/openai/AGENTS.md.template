## Project Overview

This project was set up using AI-powered discovery mode. Full configuration will be generated after analysis.

**Project Path**: {{PROJECT_PATH}}

## Temporary Instructions

Until the project is fully analyzed:

### General Guidelines
- Understand existing code patterns before making changes
- Follow consistent formatting and style
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Comment complex logic

### Security
- Never commit credentials or secrets
- Sanitize all user input
- Use parameterized database queries
- Validate at system boundaries

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase

### Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits
- Keep commits atomic
- Write clear commit messages

## Next Steps

Run `/project-discover` in Claude Code to:
1. Analyze this codebase structure
2. Detect frameworks and libraries
3. Research best practices
4. Generate comprehensive agent instructions
