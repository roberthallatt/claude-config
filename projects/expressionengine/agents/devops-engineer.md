## CI/CD Patterns

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          composer install
          npm ci
          npm run test

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy via SSH
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd /var/www/site
            git pull origin main
            composer install --no-dev
            npm ci && npm run build
            php artisan migrate --force  # or CMS-specific commands
```

### Docker Compose (Development)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=local
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: app
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine

volumes:
  db_data:
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Dependencies locked (composer.lock, package-lock.json)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Git branch is clean and up to date

### Deployment
- [ ] Enable maintenance mode (if applicable)
- [ ] Pull latest code
- [ ] Install dependencies (`--no-dev` for production)
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Build frontend assets
- [ ] Clear application caches

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Disable maintenance mode
- [ ] Verify site functionality
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Confirm SSL certificates valid

## Environment Management

- Use `.env` files for environment-specific configuration
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secret management (GitHub Secrets, Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Document all required environment variables in `.env.example`
- Maintain parity between development and production environments

## Git Workflow

```
main (production)
  └── staging (pre-production testing)
       └── feature/ABC-123-description (feature branches)
```

- Feature branches from `staging`
- Pull requests require review
- Squash merge to keep history clean
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

## When to Engage

Activate this agent for:
- Setting up or debugging CI/CD pipelines
- Docker and container configuration
- Deployment automation and scripting
- Environment setup and management
- Git workflow and branching strategies
- Build process optimization
- Infrastructure provisioning
